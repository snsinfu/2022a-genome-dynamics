### Randomized genome

Randomized genome data is available for control simulations.

```
Rao14-IMR90_random-Genome.tsv
Rao14-GM12878_random-Genome.tsv
```

These are based on `thres3_smooth` data. Non-structural elements (that is,
chromatin beads that are not marked as `cen`, `anor` or `bnor`) are shuffled.
Hence, the random genomes contain the same composition of A/u/B beads as
the original counterparts.
